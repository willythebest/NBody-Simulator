# NBody-Simulator
NBody code + 3D Rendering (w/ OpenGL)

## 1.0 Intro
Hello! Welcome to the repo for my first programming project! This project is a derivative from a school project, where myself and three other students generate a simulation that could explain the current state of what we call the Mice Galaxies. Our simulation was based on the Toomre & Toomre paper on Galactic Bridges and Tails (https://courses.physics.ucsd.edu/2017/Winter/physics141/final/toomre.pdf). However, the focus of this repo will be on my own personal contributions, the challenges I faced, and changes and additions I made after the project was over. Thanks for taking a look! Many of parts of the code are probably implemented using very naive methods, and if you have advice on better implementations on any part of the code, I would love to hear it! You can contact me at wnan.pi.95@gmail.com.
